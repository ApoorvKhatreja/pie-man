Correlated with the quality 
of restless inquisitiveness
and delight in
activity for its own 
sake there is 
the quality of 
quickness. We mean not
merely the locomotor 
agility that marks 
most monkeys 
but quickness of
perception and plan.
It is the sort of quality
that life among the
branches will engender
where it is so often a 
case of neck or nothing.
It is the quality which we
describe as being on the spot
though the
phrase has slipped from 
its original moorings. 
Speaking of his Bonnet
Monkey, an Indian macaque
second cousin to the 
kind that lives on the
Rock of Gibraltar
Professor S. J. Holmes writes: 
"For keenness of
perception, rapidity of action, facility in forming good practical
judgments about ways and means of escaping pursuit and of attaining
various other ends, Lizzie had few rivals in the animal world.... Her
perceptions and decisions were so much more rapid than my own that she
would frequently transfer her attention, decide upon a line of action,
and carry it into effect before I was aware of what she was about. Until
I came to guard against her nimble and unexpected manoeuvres, she
succeeded in getting possession of many apples and peanuts which I had
not intended to give her except upon the successful performance of some
task."
Quick to Learn
Quite fundamental to 
any understanding of 
animal behaviour is the
distinction so clearly 
drawn by Sir Ray Lankester 
between the
"little-brain" type, 
rich in inborn or 
instinctive capacities, but
relatively slow
to learn, 
and the "big-brain" type
with a relatively
poor endowment of specialised instincts
 but with great educability. The
"little-brain" type finds
its climax in ants and bees
the "big-brain"
type in horses and dogs
elephants and monkeys.
And of all animals
monkeys are the quickest to learn
if we use the word "learn" to mean
the formation of useful associations
between this and that, between a
given sense-presentation and 
a particular piece of behaviour.
The Case of Sally
Some of us remember Sally, the chimpanzee at the "Zoo" with which Dr.
Romanes used to experiment. She was taught to give her teacher the
number of straws he asked for, and she soon learned to do so up to five.
If she handed a number not asked for, her offer was refused; if she gave
the proper number, she got a piece of fruit. If she was asked for five
straws, she picked them up individually and placed them in her mouth,
and when she had gathered five she presented them together in her hand.
Attempts to teach her to give six to ten straws were not very
successful. For Sally "above six" meant "many," and besides, her limits
of patience were probably less than her range of computation. This was
hinted at by the highly interesting circumstance that when dealing with
numbers above five she very frequently doubled over a straw so as to
make it present two ends and thus appear as two straws. The doubling of
the straw looked like an intelligent device to save time, and it was
persistently resorted to in spite of the fact that her teacher always
refused to accept a doubled straw as equivalent to two straws. Here we
get a glimpse of something beyond the mere association of a
sound--"Five"--and that number of straws.
The Case of Lizzie
The front of the cage in which Professor Holmes kept Lizzie was made of
vertical bars which allowed her to reach out with her arm. On a board
with an upright nail as handle, there was placed an apple--out of
Lizzie's reach. She reached immediately for the nail, pulled the board
in and got the apple. "There was no employment of the method of trial
and error; there was direct appropriate action following the perception
of her relation to board, nail, and apple." Of course her ancestors may
have been adepts at drawing a fruit-laden branch within their reach, but
the simple experiment was very instructive. All the more instructive
because in many other cases the experiments indicate a gradual sifting
out of useless movements and an eventful retention of the one that pays.
When Lizzie was given a vaseline bottle containing a peanut and closed
with a cork, she at once pulled the cork out with her teeth, obeying the
instinct to bite at new objects, but she never learned to turn the
bottle upside down and let the nut drop out. She often got the nut, and
after some education she got it more quickly than she did at first, but
there was no indication that she ever perceived the fit and proper way
of getting what she wanted. "In the course of her intent efforts her
mind seemed so absorbed with the object of desire that it was never
focussed on the means of attaining that object. There was no
deliberation, and no discrimination between the important and the
unimportant elements in her behaviour. The gradually increasing facility
of her performances depended on the apparently unconscious elimination
of useless movements." This may be called learning, but it is learning
at a very low level; it is far from learning by ideas; it is hardly even
learning by experiment; it is not more than learning by experience, it
is not more than fumbling at learning!
Trial and Error
A higher note is struck in the behaviour of some more highly endowed
monkeys. In many experiments, chiefly in the way of getting into boxes
difficult to open, there is evidence (1) of attentive persistent
experiment (2) of the rapid elimination of ineffective movements, and
(3) of remembering the solution when it was discovered. Kinnaman taught
two macaques the Hampton Court Maze, a feat which probably means a
memory of movements, and we get an interesting glimpse in his
observation that they began to smack their lips audibly when they
reached the latter part of their course, and began to feel, dare one
say, "We are right this time."
In getting into "puzzle-boxes" and into "combination-boxes" (where the
barriers must be overcome in a definite order), monkeys learn by the
trial and error method much more quickly than cats and dogs do, and a
very suggestive fact emphasized by Professor Thorndike is "a process of
sudden acquisition by a rapid, often apparently instantaneous
abandonment of the unsuccessful movements and selection of the
appropriate one, which rivals in suddenness the selections made by human
beings in similar performances." A higher note still was sounded by one
of Thorndike's monkeys which opened a puzzle-box at once, eight months
after his previous experience with it. For here was some sort of
registration of a solution.

bc sqlite fanboi hai
lrn2use fast tools
simple "kitallis,4" like stuff
yeah
and yur parser did not exist
nub

sqlite is not fast for non-relational data, you dimwit
sqlite is fast for everything
not as fast as csv though :P
bc dekh liya kitna fast hai

you were using pie-mans 
note.
not pie-man
pie-man, karma kitallis 
pie-man: karma kitallis 
lul
wrks this tiem
k
THERE ARE TWO BOTS, THE OTHER BOTS ACCEPTS pie-man AS WELL 
sid0, FYI nikkar is on mysql
and it is 5x faster than pie-mans 
so something else is failing
sqlite is *blazing* fast
WHY WOULD YOU USE SQL FOR NON-RELATIONAL DATA
WHY WOULD YOU USE SQL FOR NON-RELATIONAL DATA
WHY WOULD YOU USE SQL FOR NON-RELATIONAL DATA
wait
use a fucking KV store
it isn't non-relational in case of nikkar
it isn't non-relational in case of nikkar
it isn't non-relational in case of nikkar
?
it is
it's simple kv
no it isn't
nikkar is on Drupal
o
k?
so, its a Drupal module.
EVEN THEN, it is so fast
something else is fail her
here*
how are you calling sqlite?
ACTION checks
owait
wait
this bot
is in ruby?
are you using a ruby-sqlite bridge?
yeah
kitallis, ^
FAIL.
your bridge sucks, as i see it.
wait
I think it might be this
what
@db.execute("insert or replace into karma values ('#{object}', '#{objVal}');")
that is what i'm doing ^
wtf is this
wait, is that even sql?
i don't think so
it inserts if there ain't no field and replaces/updates if the primary key is already there
it passes queries through an ORM?
Oo
what fail
use raw sql idiot
that is raw sql
insert or replace?
wat
that is sql i believe
ah yes, it is.
k my bad.
sqlite specific
hm
yeah
so why is it so slow
this is sqlite3 specific
i don't know, that the only thing I can see that might be causing anything
hm
kitallis: dude is it touching the hdd too much?
kitallis: you might want to turn on some sort of caching
i/o bound?
hm
k wait
kitallis, or, just look for a csv parser or write your own
the csv parser was douche
it ONLY
ONLY
reads
write your own?
and truncate-appends
so i had to write something of my own
to find entries
replace
or appends at end
etc
kitallis: you have created an index on the thing you're ++ing right
sid0: which case?
for karma
I have a hash yes
the "#{object}" above
no, sqlite index
no
:/
abe chutiya
if it isn't an index then it'll be O(n)
is it the primary key
yea
it alone?
the name
nick
ok then it should have an index implicitly
wait

lol

lol
well
i could stick with this
because i'd have flood protection anyway
so no one can spam
but multiple people can :S
beh
ok
let's try different objects
and not one
hey guise
lut4rp: try another object when i start to spam
